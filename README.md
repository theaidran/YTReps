## Overview
A simple web application to enhance English language learning through watching videos and repeating them with a flashcard system. 
The main goal here was to create an app as a simple HTML file, which you can run straight from your desktop, no servers, no frameworks, no API required.
Basicly, it is a clean YouTube player where you can add notes to each video and save it as a flashcard. Later, you can switch to the Repetitions page and start the review process.
It has compatibility with Anki format, so you can export/import flashcards to your favorite mobile/desktop app, if you are used too.
Also, it has integration with dictionaries like onelook.com, and you can add your own. But due to fact it is just a simple iframe, some websites may not work due to their policy.  

## How It Works
1. Select an built-in BBC playlist or add your own video/playlist.
2. Add new words or phrases while watching and check them with one of the chosen dictionaries.
3. Review notes/flashcards based on a spaced repetition system (Supermemo, Leitner).
4. Track progress through statistics.

## Tips
* Navigate the dictionary frame with your browser navigation bar (go back, refresh).
* Navigate YouTube player with a physical keyboard as usual. Left arrow (<-) jump back 5 seconds. Right arrow (->) jump forward 5 seconds. Play/Pause with Spacebar.
* Ads from YouTube should not be displayed when run locally. Anyway, extensions like uBlock Origin work.
* To work on two devices, you can import/export files by, e.g., Opera flow, email, or try to use bult-in synchronization/save feature (uBlock Origin needs to be off or set to website exception).

## Mobile
*  It is not fully designed to be used on smartphones. But the repetitions part is useful to make reviews on smartphones, especially if you use the synchronization feature with a desktop. To better experience, you can disable unnecessary review modes in settings.
*  If you use the standalone app YoutubeReps.html, you should open this file with a local manager, e.g., "My files" and select a browser to open that file. Due to some compatibility, policy issues, install from Play: Microsoft Edge or Samsung Internet Browser.
